# 2024 Fortune 1000 Companies Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the **2024 Fortune 1000 Companies** dataset using Python. The analysis focuses on understanding key metrics such as revenue, profit, and the number of employees, as well as industry-level insights. The project also includes visualizations to help illustrate and communicate the findings effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the **2024 Fortune 1000 Companies** dataset. It contains information about the top 1000 companies in terms of revenue, including fields such as:

- Company Name
- Industry
- Revenue (in millions)
- Profit (in millions)
- Number of Employees
- Profitability status

## Data Analysis with Pandas and Numpy

The following questions are addressed using `pandas` and `numpy`:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('2024_fortune_1000_companies.csv')

# 1. What is the total number of companies in the dataset?
total_companies = df.shape[0]

# 2. Calculate the total revenue generated by all companies combined.
total_revenue = df['Revenues_M'].sum()

# 3. What is the average revenue per company?
average_revenue = df['Revenues_M'].mean()

# 4. Which company has the highest revenue, and what is that revenue?
highest_revenue_company = df.loc[df['Revenues_M'].idxmax()]

# 5. Which company has the lowest revenue?
lowest_revenue_company = df.loc[df['Revenues_M'].idxmin()]

# 6. What is the total number of employees across all companies?
total_employees = df['Number_of_employees'].sum()

# 7. Which company has the highest number of employees?
highest_employees_company = df.loc[df['Number_of_employees'].idxmax()]

# 8. What is the average number of employees per company?
average_employees = df['Number_of_employees'].mean()

# 9. What is the total profit generated by all companies combined?
total_profit = df['Profits_M'].sum()

# 10. Which industry has the highest average revenue?
industry_avg_revenue = df.groupby('Industry')['Revenues_M'].mean().idxmax()

# 11. What is the average profit margin (Profit/Revenue) across all companies?
df['Profit_Margin'] = df['Profits_M'] / df['Revenues_M']
average_profit_margin = df['Profit_Margin'].mean()

# 12. How many companies are profitable?
profitable_companies = df[df['Profitable'] == 'yes'].shape[0]

# 13. How many companies reported a loss?
loss_reporting_companies = df[df['Profitable'] != 'yes'].shape[0]

# 14. Which industry has the most companies listed?
most_companies_industry = df['Industry'].value_counts().idxmax()

# 15. What is the total revenue by industry?
industry_revenue = df.groupby('Industry')['Revenues_M'].sum()

# 16. What is the total profit by industry?
industry_profit = df.groupby('Industry')['Profits_M'].sum()

# 17. What is the average number of employees by industry?
industry_avg_employees = df.groupby('Industry')['Number_of_employees'].mean()

# 18. Which company has the highest profit margin?
highest_profit_margin_company = df.loc[df['Profit_Margin'].idxmax()]

# 19. How many companies have more than 100,000 employees?

# 22. What is the range of profit margins across all companies?
profit_margin_range = df['Profit_Margin'].max() - df['Profit_Margin'].min()

# 23. What percentage of companies are in each industry?
industry_percentage = df['Industry'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100

# 24. What is the correlation between revenue and number of employees?
revenue_employees_corr = df[['Revenues_M', 'Number_of_employees']].corr().iloc[0, 1]

# 25. What is the total revenue and profit for the top 5 industries?
top_5_industries = df.groupby('Industry').agg({'Revenues_M':'sum', 'Profits_M':'sum'}).nlargest(5, 'Revenues_M')

# 26. What is the industry with the lowest average profit margin?
lowest_avg_profit_margin_industry = df.groupby('Industry')['Profit_Margin'].mean().idxmin()

# 27. What is the standard deviation of revenue across all companies?
revenue_std_dev = df['Revenues_M'].std()

high_employee_profit_margin = df[df['Number_of_employees'] > 50000]['Profit_Margin'].mean()

# 29. What is the median number of employees in each industry?
median_employees_by_industry = df.groupby('Industry')['Number_of_employees'].median()

# 30. What is the percentage change in revenue for companies reporting a profit versus those reporting a loss?
profit_reported_revenue_change = df[df['Profitable'] == 'yes']['Revenues_M'].pct_change().mean()
